 Wiki Crawler
#This crawler is limited to crawl certain Wiki pages and get names, images and their hrefs accordingly. Images are stored elsewhere, info becomes a database.
#We use Yolo Models to clean the data, taking only images which have people in it, wiki can have a lot of unwanted images.
Since YOLO model is kind of a transfer learning model, we have to download the weights, which cannot be uploaded on github, 
## You can download the YOLO weights here : "https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-spp.weights"
